Thanks for trying out Happenings, my first WordPress theme made available in the WordPress Theme Repository!

The side bar is fixed in place and is not optional as it's integral to the entire site, and a logo placement, which appears at the top of the sidebar, is highly recommended; a logo will "knock out" the site's title. Logos predominantly green or blue will not work well, but yellow, black, or gold will fit nicely; as you'd expect, the logo is optional.

Header
==========

The slider unitizes Slick Slider, and you can make adjustments (such as adding round dots and side arrows) by going to the slick.css file in your WordPress editor. Images placed as slides will need to be either set at 900x375 pixels or cropped within WordPress in order to look right. Place images at different dimensions at your own risk. For more settings, like image timing, you'll need to dig deeper via another route to the js/slick.js file within the theme's folder. You can learn more about Slick Slider at kenwheeler.github.io/slick. 

Note: When any slides are placed, the optional static header image will be hidden.

Menu
=========

The drop down menus only go one level deep.
